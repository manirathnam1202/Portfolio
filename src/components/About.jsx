        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello! I’m Manirathnam N., a recent MCA graduate and a passionate frontend developer. My journey into web development began with a fascination for creating user-friendly applications that enhance everyday experiences. I have a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, and I have completed several beginner projects using the React framework, where I focused on user experience and accessibility.
        I believe these elements are key to creating impactful web applications. I’m excited to apply my skills in a professional environment and am particularly interested in projects that challenge me to grow. Feel free to explore my projects and reach out if you’d like to collaborate or learn more!</p>
